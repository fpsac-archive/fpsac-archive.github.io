<h2>Participant Support</h2>

<p>
The conference expects to provide limited financial support to cover travel 
and living expenses during the conference. First priority will be given to 
junior faculty, graduate and postdoctorial students, and - in some exceptional 
   cases - to qualified undergraduates. If you are interested in support, then
   please send your request not later than <b> March 1, 2009.</b>

<p>
Those requesting support should also ask a mentor to write a supporting letter 
on their behalf.
The letter can be attached it to the request form or can be sent independently.
If the participant is still a student then this letter should preferably
be written by the participant's faculty supervisor.
