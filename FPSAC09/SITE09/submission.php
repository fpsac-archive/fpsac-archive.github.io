<p>The accepted extended abstract will be published in a proceedings

target="_blank">DMTCS (Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer
Science)</a>. The authors will retain the right of publishing a full

<h3>Instructions for Authors:</h3>

<p>In order to prepare your submission, please take the following steps
to format your document according to the specifications of DMTCS
(Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science). Please
prepare your document using standard LaTeX. If you have any user
macros, please include them in your submission. We thank you very much
for your cooperation.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Please download the <a href="dmtcs.cls"
    target="_blank">dmtcs.cls</a> class file, and place it in the
    same directory as your submission. Use \documentclass{dmtcs}
    to prepare your document.
  </li>

  <li>
    To prepare your document, please follow the directions given in
    <a href="sample.tex" target="_blank">sample.tex </a>. 
    Submissions should be submitted as either postscript
    or pdf files. Please LaTeX the <a href="sample.tex"
    target="_blank">sample.tex</a> to make sure that your
    output matches the corresponding <a href="sample.pdf"
    target="_blank">sample.pdf</a> file.
  </li>

  <li>
    Fill in your author and institution information.
  </li>

  <li>
    If your title is rather long, please give a short title
    substitution for the inside headers, e.g. \title[short
    title]{Long, wordy title} . The same goes for your name, if you
    have a preferred short form.
  </li>

  <li>
    You must provide 3 to 6 keywords in the form
    \keywords{keyword1, keyword2, keyword3}
    that describe the topic of your paper.
  </li>

  <li>
    Include a summary with citations written out rather than
    referencing the bibliography. FPSAC/SFCA has a tradition of
    encouraging bilingualism, and thus you are strongly encouraged to
    include a summary in the French language. There are people
    available to help you with this, if help is required. Please
    format your summary as follows ( Note the nested structure ):

<pre>
\begin{abstract}
\paragraph{Abstract.}
text in english

\paragraph{R\'esum\'e.}
texte en francais

\end{abstract}
</pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    Submissions, when compiled using the dmtcs.cls class file, should
    not exceed 12 pages.<br />
    Papers should be submitted electronically.
  </li>
</ol>
