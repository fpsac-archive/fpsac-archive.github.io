Software demonstrations
    Demonstrations of software relevant to the topics of the conference
    are encouraged. People interested in giving a software demonstration
    should submit through our website before February 20, 2009, a paper
    briefly explaining the software, and including the hardware
    requirements.

Graduate student papers
    In an ongoing FPSAC tradition, an award will be made for the best
    paper submitted by a graduate student.  Students submitting extended
    abstracts are invited to indicate their eligibility for this award.

Participant support
    Limited funds are available for partial support of participants,
    in particular for students, junior scientists
    and mathematicians from underrepresented groups. Requests should
    contain a letter of recommendation and include the estimated
    transportation and living expenses for the duration of the conference
    as well as the amount of any support available from other sources.
    All requests should be sent by March 1, 2009 to an address which
    we will announce at a later point.
