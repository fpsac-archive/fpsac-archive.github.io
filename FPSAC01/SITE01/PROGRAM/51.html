    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    Given a fixed connected graph $H$, a $H$-free graph is one which does not
contain any subgraph isomorphic to $H$. We describe a very general technique
which can be applied to enumerate any labeled graphs without isomorph for
the first multicyclic components, i.e., connected graphs with $n$ vertices and 
$(n+k)$ edges for \textit{small $k$}. The results are obtained by 
means of generating functions which
are shown to verify a differential equation of ``heat conduction'' type,
reducing the enumeration of $H$-free labeled graphs to the 
enumeration of two types of graphs;
graphs with one and only one occurrence of $H$ and graphs with many
occurrences of $H$ but necessarily juxtaposed. Then, general methods are
presented and used to enumerate the first low order cyclic components of
these two types of graphs. These techniques are less efficient and
impracticable for greater $k$, but supply the lack of combinatorial results
to deal with labeled $H$-free graphs. 
Furthermore, the methods are illustrated by the
 examples of the enumeration of $C_{3}$-free or triangle-free
 and $K_{4}$-free labeled graphs.
