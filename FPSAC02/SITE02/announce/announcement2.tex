The idea is that those who wish to submit full articles willonly have to undergo one cycle of refereeing. Their papers will appearboth in the conference proceedings and in the subsequent publishedjournal volume. If extended abstracts are submitted, they will, aspreviously, be refereed for the conference. Subsequently, authors will beinvited to submit full articles of the extended abstracts for journalpublication. These will then be refereed by the relevant journal.The aim of the current proposal is to simplify matters for those readyto submit a full article. Please indicate, on your submission, whetherit is an extended abstract or a full article.\smallskip\noindentTo submit your papers, preferably use the submission server of theconference, which  is  available through the Internet at the URL{\verb!http://www.fpsac.ms.unimelb.edu.au/!}.If you are unable to use the web for submission, please email{\verb!fpsac-submission@ms.unimelb.edu.au!} forfurther instructions.\smallskip\noindentThe submitted papers should begin with a summary written in Englishand French (translations will be provided if necessary).  Authors shouldindicate the mode of presentation which they consider appropriate fortheir paper, i.e. lecture or poster session. Notification ofacceptance or rejection is scheduled for late February 2002.%\pagebreak\colitem{Open problem session}\noindentContributions to the problem session are invited in advance ofthe conference dates. People interested in submitting a problemshould submit it as described above, before {\it June 1, 2002}.\pagebreak\colitem{Software demonstrations}\noindentDemonstrations of software relevant to the topics of the conferenceare encouraged. People interested in giving a software demonstrationshould submit before {\it February 15, 2002} a paper including thehardware  requirements, as described above.\colitem{Program committee}\medskip\begin{tabular}{ll}Susumu Ariki (Tokyo)\qquad & Gilbert Labelle (UQAM)\\Sara Billey (MIT) \qquad & Jean-Christophe Novelli (Lille)\\Maylis Delest (France) \qquad & Renzo Pinzani (Florence)\\Art Duval (Texas-El Paso)\qquad & Andrew Rechnitzer (Toronto \&Melbourne)\\Omar Foda (Melbourne, {\it Co-Chair})\qquad &Frank Sottile  (Mass.)\\Sergey Fomin (Michigan)\qquad & Itaru Terada (Tokyo)\\Vesselin Gasharov (Cornell) \qquad & Jean-Yves Thibon (Marne-la-Vall{\'e}e)\\Anthony Guttmann (Melbourne, {\it Co-Chair})\qquad & Dominic Welsh(Oxford)\\Angele Hamel (Wilfrid Laurier)\qquad & Trevor Welsh (Melbourne)\\Ron King (Southampton) \qquad & Nicholas Wormald (Melbourne)\end{tabular}\colitem{Participant support}\noindentWe have applied for grants in the USA, Canada, France and Australia toprovide partial support of participants from those countries---inparticular of students and junior scientists.
