      Down-up algebras originated in the study of differential posets. 
      In this paper we discuss their combinatorial origins,  
      representations, and structure.  Down-up algebras
      exhibit many of the important features of the universal enveloping
      algebra  $U(\fsl)$ of the Lie algebra $\fsl$ including a
      Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt type basis and a well-behaved representation theory.
      They have many interesting connections with Weyl algebras, quantum groups, 
      and Witten's 
      deformations of $U(\fsl)$.

      \m
      In [St2], Stanley introduced a class of partially ordered sets,
      which he termed {\it differential posets}.  Many of the
      remarkable enumerative and combinatorial properties of these posets 
      involve counting saturated chains $y_1 \prec  y_2 \prec  \dots
      \prec y_k$  or Hasse walks $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_k$, (where either $y_{i+1}$
      covers $y_i$ or $y_i$ covers $y_{i+1}$).  
      Essential in the computations are two operators,
      $d$ (down) and  $u$ (up), which are defined on the complex vector space 
      $\C P$ having basis the elements of the poset $P$.  
      If $y \in P$, then $d(y)$ is the sum of all elements that $y$ covers 
      and $u(y)$ is the
      sum of all elements that cover
      $y$.  For many posets the down and up operators give well-defined
      linear transformations of $\C P$.  Precursors
      of the operators $d$ and $u$ appeared in [St1] and [P], where
      they were used to show posets are Sperner or rank unimodal. 
      \m
      The characterizing property of an $r$-differential poset is
      that the down and up
      operators satisfy
      $du - u d = r I$  for some positive integer $r$ (see [St2, Thm. 2.2]),
      where $I$ is the identity transformation on $\C P$. 
      Thus, the poset affords a representation of the  Weyl algebra, (the associative
      algebra with generators
      $y,x$ subject to the relation $y x - x y = 1$),  via the mapping $y \mapsto d/r$,
      and $x \mapsto u$.  Since the Weyl algebra also can be realized
      as differential operators $y \mapsto d/dx$ and $x \mapsto x$ (multiplication
      by $x$)  on $\C[x]$, Stanley referred to the 
      posets satisfying $du-ud = rI$
      as $r$-{\it differential}
      or simply {\it differential} when $r = 1$.  Fomin [F] studied
      essentially the same class of posets for $r = 1$, calling them
      ‘‘$Y$-graphs''.  This terminology comes from the fact that Young's
      lattice $Y$ of all partitions of all nonnegative integers 
      is the prototypical example.    
      \m
      A partition $\mu$ of a nonnegative integer $m$ can be
      regarded as a descending sequence 
      $\mu = (\mu_1 \geq \mu_2 \geq \dots)$ of parts whose sum $|\mu| = \sum_i
      \mu_i$ equals $m$.  If  $\nu = (\nu_1 \geq \nu_2 \geq
      \dots)$ is a second partition, then
      $\mu \leq \nu$ when $\mu_i \leq \nu_i$ for all $i$.   The partition
      $\nu$ covers $\mu$ (written here as $\mu \prec \nu$) if $\mu < \nu$
      and $|\nu| = 1 + |\mu|$.  Thus, $\mu \prec \nu$ if the partition $\mu$ is
      obtained from $\nu$ by subtracting 1 from exactly one of the parts of $\nu$,
      and $d(\nu)$ is the sum of all such $\mu$. Analogously,
      $u(\nu)$ is the sum of all partitions $\pi$ obtained from $\nu$ by
      adding 1 to one part of $\nu$.  Young's lattice $Y$ is
      a 1-differential poset, and $Y^r$ is $r$-differential 
      ([St2, Cor. 1.4]). 
      \m
      The down and up operators on Young's lattice  have a representation
      theoretic significance.  The simple modules of the symmetric group
      $S_n$ are indexed by the partitions $\nu$ of $n$.  Upon restriction to
      $S_{n-1}$, the representation labelled by $\nu$
      decomposes into a direct sum of simple $S_{n-1}$-modules
      indexed by the
      partitions
      $\mu \prec \nu$, so it is given by $d(\nu)$.  When the
      simple module labelled by $\nu$ is induced to a representation
      of $S_{n+1}$, it decomposes into a sum of simple $S_{n+1}$-modules indexed by
      the partitions $\pi$ of $n+1$ such that $\nu \prec \pi$,  which is just
      $u(\nu)$.    
      \m 
      In his study [T1] of
      uniform posets, Terwilliger considered finite ranked posets $P$
      whose down and up operators satisfy the
      following relation 
      $$ d_{i}d_{i+1}u_{i}=\alpha _{i}d_{i}u_{i-1}d_{i}+\beta
      _{i}u_{i-2}d_{i-1}d_{i} +\gamma _{i}d_{i}, $$
      \n where $d_{i}$ and $u_{i}$ denote the restriction of $d$ and $u$ to the
      elements of rank $i$. (There is an analogous second relation,
      $$ d_{i+1}u_{i}u_{i-1}=\alpha _{i}u_{i-1}d_{i}u_{i-1}+\beta
      _{i}u_{i-1}u_{i-2}d_{i-1} +\gamma _{i}u_{i-1}, $$
       
      \n which holds automatically in this case because $d_{i+1}$ and $u_i$ are
      adjoint operators relative to a certain bilinear form.)
      In many examples the constants in these relations do not
      depend on the rank $i$.   In particular, a poset whose down and up
      operators satisfy
      $$
      \aligned
      d^{2}u & = q(q+1)dud -q^{3}ud^{2}+rd \\
      du^2 & = q(q+1)udu - q^3 u^2 d + r u \\
      \endaligned $$
      \n where $q$ and $r$ are fixed complex numbers is 
      said to be  {\it $(q,r)$-differential}.   Many interesting
      examples of $(q,r)$-differential posets in [T1] arise
      from considering certain subspaces of a vector space over the
      field $GF(q)$ of $q$ elements:
      \m
      \item{(1)} Assume $W$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over
      $GF(q)$ and consider the set of pairs $P = \{(U,f) \mid U$ is
      a subspace of $W$ and $f$ is an alternating bilinear form on $U\}$
      with the ordering:  $(U,f) \leq (V,g)$  if $U$ is a subspace of $V$
      and $g|_U = f$.  Then $P$ is a $(q,r)$-differential poset
      with $r = -q^n(q+1)$. 
      \m
      \item{(2)} In example (1),  replace ‘‘an alternating bilinear form'' with
      ‘‘a quadratic form''.  The resulting poset $P$ is $(q,
      -q^{n+1}(q+1))$-differential.
      \m
      \item{(3)} In this example assume $W$ is an $n$-dimensional space over
      $GF(q^2)$ and the bilinear forms are Hermitian. The poset
      $P$ is $(q^{2},-q^{2n+1}(q^{2}+1))$-differential in this case.

      \subhead {Down-up algebras} \endsubhead 
      \m
       
      To better understand the algebra generated by the down and up operators of a
      poset and its action on the poset,  we introduced the notion of
      a down-up algebra in our joint work with Roby (see [BR]).  Although the initial
      motivation for our investigations came from posets, we made no assumptions
      about the existence of posets whose down and up operators satisfy our
      relations.  However, when such a poset exists, it affords a representation
      of the down-up algebra, so our primary focus in [BR]  was on determining
      explicit information about the
      representations of down-up algebras.    
      \m 
      \proclaim {Definition 1} Let $\a,\be,\ga$ be fixed but arbitrary complex numbers. 
      The unital associative algebra $A(\a,\be,\ga)$ over $\C$ with generators
      $d,u$ and defining relations
      \s
      \item {}{(R1)} $d^2u = \a dud + \be ud^2 + \ga d,$
      \s 
      \item {}{(R2)} $du^2 = \a udu + \be u^2 d + \ga u,$ 
      \m
      \n is a down-up algebra. \endproclaim   
      \m
      It is easy to see that when $\ga \neq 0$ the down-up algebra $A(\a,\be,\ga)$
      is isomorphic to $A(\a,\be,1)$ by the map, $d \mapsto d'$, $u \mapsto \ga u'$.
      Therefore, it would suffice to treat just two cases $\ga = 0,1$, but to
      avoid dividing considerations into these two cases, we retain
      the notation $\ga$. 
      \b
      \subhead Examples of down-up algebras  \endsubhead
      \m
      \n {\bf Example (i)}. \   If $B$ is the associative algebra generated by the down
      and up operators $d,u$  of
      a $(q,r)$-differential poset,  
      then relations (R1) and (R2) hold with 
      $\a = q(q+1)$, $\be = -q^{3}$, and $\ga =  r$.  Thus, $B$ is a homomorphic image
      of the algebra $A(\a,\be,\ga)$ with these parameters, and the action of
      $B$ on the poset gives a representation of $A(\a,\be,\ga)$. 
      \m 
      \n {\bf Example (ii)}. \  The relation $du - ud = rI$ of an $r$-differential poset
      can be multiplied on the left by $d$ and on the right by $d$ and
      the resulting equations can be added to get the relation
      $d^2 u - ud^2 = 2rd$ of a $(-1,2r)$-differential poset.
      Thus, the Weyl algebra is a homomorphic image (by the ideal generated
      by $du-ud - r1$)  of the algebra $A(0,1,2r)$.  
      Similarly, the $q$-Weyl algebra is a homomorphic image of the algebra 
      $A(0,q^2,(q+1))$ by the ideal generated by $du - qud - 1$.  
      The skew polynomial
      algebra $\C_q[d,u]$, or quantum plane (see [M]), is the associative algebra with
      generators $d,u$ which satisfy the relation  $du = qud$.  Therefore,
      $\C_q[d,u]$ is a homomorphic image (by the ideal generated by $du-qud$)
      of the algebra $A(2q,-q^2,0)$. 
      \m
      \n
      {\bf Example (iii)}. \   Consider the poset ${\Cal L}(2,2) = \{ {\u a} = (a_1,a_2)
      \mid  2 \geq a_1 \geq a_2$ and $a_1,a_2 \in \Z_{\geq 0}\}$ with the order relation
      $\u a \leq \u b$ if $a_i \leq b_i$ for $i = 1,2$.  This is just
      the set of partitions which fit into a $2 \times 2$ box.  By direct calculation
      it is easy to verify that the down and up operators on this poset satisfy
      $d^2u = dud - ud^2 +d$ and  $du^2 = udu - u^2 d + u$, so the algebra they  
      generate is a homomorphic image of the down-up algebra $A(1,-1,1)$.  
      \m 
      \n {\bf Example (iv)}. \   Suppose $\g$ is a 3-dimensional Lie algebra over $\C$
      with basis
      $x,y,[x,y]$  such that $[x[x,y]] = \ga x$ and  $[[x,y],y] = \ga y$.  
      In the universal enveloping
      algebra $U(\g)$ of $\g$ where $[x,y] = xy-yx$, these relations become
      $$\aligned
      & x^2 y -2 xyx + yx^2 = \ga x \\
      & xy^2 -2yxy +  y^2x = \ga y. \\
      \endaligned$$
      \n Thus, $U(\g)$ is a homomorphic image of the down-up algebra $A(2,-1,\ga)$
      via the mapping $\phi: A(2,-1,\ga) \rightarrow U(\g)$ with $\phi: d \mapsto x$,
      $\phi: u
      \mapsto y$.  The
      mapping $\psi: \g \rightarrow A(2,-1,\ga)$ with $\psi: x \mapsto d$, $
      \psi: y \mapsto u$,
      and $\psi: [x,y] \mapsto du - ud$ extends, by the universal property of $U(\g)$,
      to an algebra homomorphism $\psi: U(\g) \rightarrow A(2,-1,\ga)$ which
      is the inverse of $\phi$. 
      Consequently, $U(\g)$ is isomorphic to $A(2,-1,\ga)$.  
      \m 
      The Lie algebra
      $\fsl$ of $2 \times 2$ complex matrices of trace zero has a standard
      basis $e = E_{1,2}, f = E_{2,1},$ and $h = E_{1,1}-E_{2,2}$ of
      matrix units, which satisfies $[e,f] = h, \; [h,e] = 2e$, and $[h,f] = -2 f$. From
      this we see that $U(\fsl) \cong A(2,-1,-2)$.  The Heisenberg Lie algebra $\frak H$ has
      a basis $x,y,z$ where $[x,y] = z$, and $[z,{\frak H}] = 0$,
      so $U({\frak H}) \cong
      A(2,-1,0)$.  
      \m
      \n {\bf Example (v)}. \   The $2 \times 2$ complex matrices  
      $y = \left (\matrix  y_1 & y_2 \\
                           y_3 & y_4  \endmatrix \right )$
      with supertrace $y_1-y_4 = 0$  is the special linear
      Lie superalgebra  $L = \fss = L_{\o 0} \oplus L_{\o 1}$ 
      under the supercommutator $[x,y] =
      xy-(-1)^{ab}yx$ for $x\in L_{\o a},\;y\in L_{\o b}$.   It has a 
      presentation by generators $e,f$ (which belong to $L_{\o 1}$ and can be identified
      with the matrix units $e = E_{1,2}$, $f = E_{2,1}$) and relations
      $[e,[e,f]] = 0$, $[[e,f],f] = 0$, $[e,e] = 0$, $[f,f] = 0$.
      The universal enveloping algebra $U(\fss)$ of $\fss$  has generators $e,f$ and
      relations $e^2 f - f e^2 = 0$, $e f^2 - f^2 e = 0$, $e^2 = 0$, $f^2 = 0$.
      Thus, $U(\fss)$ is a homomorphic image of the down-up algebra
      $A(0,1,0)$ by the ideal generated by the elements $e^2$ and $f^2$, which are
      central in $A(0,1,0)$.   
      \m
      \n {\bf Example (vi)}. \   The orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra $\osp(1,2) = L_{\o 0}
      \oplus L_{\o 1}$ has generators $x,y \in L_{\o 1}$ which satisfy
      $$xy + yx = t \in L_{\o 0}  \quad \quad tx - xt = x \quad \quad yt -ty = y. $$
      \n By combining these relations, we see that its universal enveloping algebra
      \break  $U(\osp(1,2))$ is a homomorphic image of $A(0,1,1)$.  
      \m
      \n {\bf Example (vii)}. \   Consider the field $\C(q)$ of rational functions in the
      indeterminate $q$ over the complex numbers, and let
      $U_q(\g)$ be the quantized enveloping algebra (quantum group) of
      a finite-dimensional simple complex Lie algebra $\g$  corresponding
      to the Cartan matrix $\frak A = (a_{i,j})_{i,j= 1}
      ^n$. There are relatively prime integers $\ell_i$ so that
      the matrix $(\ell_i a_{i,j})$ is symmetric.  Let 
      $$q_i = q^{\ell_i},\quad \quad \text {and} \quad \quad  
      [m]_i = \frac {q_i^{m} - q_i^{-m}} {q_i -
      q_i^{-1}}$$
      \n for all $m \in \Z_{\geq 0}$.  When $m \geq 1$,  let 
      $[m]_i! = \prod_{j = 1}^m [j]_i.$  Set $[0]_i! = 1$ and define
      $$\left [\matrix m \\ n \\ \endmatrix
      \right]_i = \frac{[m]_i!}
      {[n]_i! [m-n]_i!}.$$ 
      \n Then $U = U_q(\g)$ is the unital associative algebra over $\C(q)$ with generators 
      $E_i, F_i, K_{i}, K_{i}^{-1}$ ($i = 1, \dots, n$) subject to the relations
      \b
      \item {}{(Q1)} $K_i K_i^{-1} = K_i^{-1} K_i,$
      \quad \quad $K_i K_j = K_jK_i$
      \m
      \item {}{(Q2)} $K_i E_j K_i^{-1} =
      q_i^{a_{i,j}}E_j$ \quad \quad  $K_i F_j K_i^{-1} =
      q_i^{-a_{i,j}}F_j$ 
      \m
      \item {}{(Q3)} $E_i F_j - F_j E_i
      = \displaystyle \delta_{i,j} \frac {K_i - K_i^{-1}}
      {q_i - q_i^{-1}}$ 
      \m
      \item {}{(Q4)}$\displaystyle \sum_{k = 0}^{1-a_{i,j}} (-1)^k
      \left [\matrix 1-a_{i,j}\\ k  \\ \endmatrix
      \right]_i E_i^{1-a_{i,j}-k} E_j E_i^k = 0$ \quad \quad  for  \quad $i \neq j$
      \m
      \item {}{(Q5)}$\displaystyle \sum_{k = 0}^{1-a_{i,j}}
      (-1)^k\left [\matrix 1-a_{i,j}\\ k  \\ \endmatrix
      \right]_i F_i^{1-a_{i,j}-k} F_j F_i^k = 0$ \quad \quad for \quad $i \neq j.$
      \b
      Suppose $a_{i,j} = -1 = a_{j,i}$ for some $i \neq j$, and consider the subalgebra
      $U_{i,j}$ generated by $E_i, E_j$. In this special case, the quantum Serre
      relation (Q4) reduces to
      $$\aligned & E_i^2 E_j - [2]_i E_i E_j E_i +
      E_j E_i^2 = 0\quad \quad \text {and}  \\
      & E_j^2 E_i - [2]_j E_j E_i E_j +
      E_i E_j^2 = 0.\\
      \endaligned $$
      \n Since $-\ell_i = \ell_ia_{i,j} = \ell_ja_{j,i} = -\ell_j$, the coefficients
      $[2]_i$ and $[2]_j$ are equal. 
      The algebra  $U_{i,j}$ (with $q$ specialized to
      a complex number which is not a root of unity) is isomorphic to
      $A([2]_i,-1,0)$ by the mapping $E_i \mapsto d$,
      $E_j \mapsto u$.   The same result is true if
      the corresponding $F$'s are used in place of the $E$'s. 
      In particular, when $\g = \fst$ ($3 \times 3$ matrices of trace 0), the 
      algebra $U_{i,j}$  is just the subalgebra of $U_q(\fst)$
      generated by the $E$'s. 
      \m 
      \n {\bf Example (viii)}. \   To provide an explanation of the existence of quantum
      groups, Witten ([W1], [W2]) introduced a 7-parameter deformation of the
      universal enveloping algebra $U(\fsl)$.
      Witten's deformation is a unital associative algebra
      over a field $\K$ (which is algebraically closed of
      characteristic zero and which could be
      assumed to be $\C$) and depends on a 7-tuple $\u \xi =
      (\xi_1, \dots, \xi_7)$ of elements of $\K$.  It has
      a presentation by generators $x,y,z$ and defining
      relations
      $$\align 
      & xz - \xi_1 z x = \xi_2 x \tag 2\\
      & zy - \xi_3 yz = \xi_4 y \tag 3\\
      & yx - \xi_5 xy = \xi_6 z^2 + \xi_7 z. \tag 4 \\
      \endalign$$
      \n We denote the resulting algebra by $ {\frak W}(\u \xi) $.  
      In applications of these deformation algebras, the parameters 
      depend on the coupling constant of the particular physical theory,
      and Witten [W2] gives an evaluation of them in the special
      case of the three-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theory. 
      \m 
      Let us assume $\xi_6 = 0$ and $\xi_7 \neq 0$.   Then
      substituting expression (4) into (2) and (3)  and rearranging shows that
       
      $$\aligned & -\xi_5 x^2y + (1  + \xi_1\xi_5)xyx - \xi_1yx^2 = \xi_2 \xi_7 x
      \\
      & -\xi_5 xy^2 + (1+\xi_3\xi_5)yxy -\xi_3 y^2 x = \xi_4 \xi_7 y. \\
      \endaligned $$
      \n In particular, when $\xi_5 \neq 0$, $\xi_1 = \xi_3$,
      and $\xi_2 = \xi_4$ we obtain
      $$
      \aligned
      & x^2 y = \frac{1+\xi_1 \xi_5}{\xi_5} xyx - \frac{\xi_1}{\xi_5}yx^2 - 
      \frac{\xi_2 \xi_7}{\xi_5} x \\
      & x y^2 = \frac{1+\xi_1 \xi_5}{\xi_5} yxy - \frac{\xi_1}{\xi_5}y^2x - 
      \frac{\xi_2 \xi_7}{\xi_5}y. \\
      \endaligned$$
      \n From this it is easy to see that 
      a Witten deformation algebra ${\frak W}(\u \xi)  $ with
      $\xi_6 = 0$, $\xi_5\xi_7 \neq 0$, $\xi_1 = \xi_3$,
      and $\xi_2 = \xi_4$ is a homomorphic image
      of the down-up algebra $A(\a,\be,\gamma)$ 
      with
      $$\a = \frac{1+\xi_1 \xi_5}{\xi_5}, \quad \quad 
      \be = - \frac{\xi_1}{\xi_5}, \quad \quad \gamma = -\frac{\xi_2
      \xi_7}{\xi_5}. \tag 5$$
      \n In fact, in [B, Thm. 2.6] we proved the following
      \m
      \proclaim{Proposition 6} A Witten deformation algebra ${\frak W}(\u \xi)  $
      with
      $$\xi_6 = 0, \;\; \xi_5\xi_7 \neq 0, \; \xi_1 = \xi_3, \; \;\text{and}
      \;\;\xi_2 = \xi_4 \tag 7$$
      \n is isomorphic to the down-up algebra $A(\a,\be,\ga)$
      with $\a,\be,\ga$ given by (5). Conversely, any
      down-up algebra $A(\a,\be,\ga)$ with not both $\a$ and $\be$
      equal to 0 is isomorphic to a Witten deformation algebra ${\frak W}(\u \xi)  $
      whose parameters satisfy (7). \endproclaim 
      \m
      A deformation algebra ${\frak W}(\u \xi)  $
      has a filtration,  and 
      Le Bruyn ([L1], [L2]) investigated the algebras ${\frak W}(\u \xi)  $ 
      whose associated graded algebras are Auslander regular. 
      They determine a 3-parameter family of deformation algebras which
      are called {\it conformal $\fsl$ algebras} and whose defining relations
      are 
      $$xz - a zx = x, \quad \quad 
      zy - a yz = y, \quad \quad yx - c xy = b z^2 + z  \tag 8$$
      \n When $c \neq 0$ and $b = 0$, the conformal $\fsl$ algebra
      with defining relations given by (8) is isomorphic to
      the down-up algebra $A(\a,\be,\ga)$ with
      $\a = c^{-1}(1+ac), \be = -ac^{-1}$ and $\ga = -c^{-1}$.
      If $b= c = 0$ and $a \neq 0$, then the conformal $\fsl$ algebra
      is isomorphic to the down-up algebra $A(\a,\be,\ga)$
      with $\a = a^{-1}$, $\be = 0$ and $\ga = -a^{-1}$.    
      \m
      In a recent paper [K1], Kulkarni has shown that under certain
      assumptions on the parameters a Witten deformation algebra is isomorphic to
      a conformal $\fsl$ algebra or to a double skew polynomial extension.
      Kulkarni studies the simple modules of
      the conformal $sl_2$ algebras and of the skew polynomial
      algebras.  Critical to the investigations in [K1] is the
      observation that the conformal $\fsl$ algebra of (8) can be realized as a 
      {\it hyperbolic
      ring}.  Kulkarni then applies results of Rosenberg [R]
      on noncommutative algebraic geometry 
      to describe the left ideals in the left spectrum of the algebra and to
      determine the maximal left ideals for the conformal $sl_2$ algebras.
      \m 
      \n {\bf Example (ix)}. \ The quadratic Askey-Wilson algebras studied in
      [GLZ] can be regarded as having generators $a,b$ and defining relations
      which depend on fixed parameters $(\a,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon, \zeta,\eta,\mu,\nu)$
      according to:
      $$\aligned a^2b & = \a aba - ba^2 + \zeta(ab+ba) +  \eta a^2 + \gamma a + \delta b
      + \mu 1 \\
      ab^2 & = \a bab - b^2a + \eta(ab+ba) +\zeta b^2 + \gamma b + \epsilon a
      + \nu 1. \\ \endaligned$$
      \n It is apparent that when $\delta=\epsilon=\zeta=\eta=\mu=\nu = 0$, this
      algebra is just the down-up algebra $A(\a,-1,\ga)$. Askey-Wilson algebras
      are related to the Leonard systems introduced in [T2] as abstract 
      algebraic generalizations
      of $q$-Racah polynomials and of families of orthogonal polynomials that
      include the quantum $q$-Krawtchouk, Racah, Hahn, dual Hahn, and
      Krawtchouk polynomials.

      \subhead {Highest weight modules} \endsubhead
      \m 
      Down-up algebras have a rich representation theory (see [BR, Sec. 2]). In particular,
      they have highest weight modules and weight modules 
      which mimic those of $\fsl$. 
      \m 
      A module $V$ for $A = A(\a,\be,\ga)$
      is said to be a {\it highest weight module of weight $\l$}
      if $V$ has a vector $y_0$ such that $d \cdot y_0 = 0$,
      $(d u) \cdot y_0 = \l y_0$, and $V = Ay_0$.   The vector
      $y_0$ is a {\it maximal vector} or {\it highest weight vector} of
      $V$.  
      \m 
      \proclaim {Proposition 9} (See [BR, Sec. 2])  Set $\l_{-1} = 0$
      and let
      $\l_0 = \l \in \C$ be arbitrary.    For $n \geq 1$,  
       define $\l_n$ inductively by the  
      recurrence relation, 
      $$\lambda_n = \a \lambda_{n-1} + \be \l_{n-2} + \ga. \tag 10$$
      \n The $\C$-vector space $V(\l)$ with basis $\{v_n \mid n = 0,1,2, \dots\}$
      and with $A(\a,\be,\ga)$-action given by
      $$\aligned
      d \cdot v_n & = \l_{n-1} v_{n-1}, \quad n \geq 1, \quad \text {and}
      \quad d
      \cdot v_0 = 0 \\
      u \cdot v_n & = v_{n+1}. \\
      \endaligned \tag 11$$
      \n is a highest weight
      module for $A(\a,\be,\ga)$.  Every $A(\a,\be,\ga)$-module of
      highest weight $\l$ is a homomorphic image of $V(\l)$.  The module
      $V(\l)$ is simple
      if and only if $\l_n \neq 0$ for any $n$. 
      \endproclaim
      \m 
      Because it shares the
      same universal property and
      many of the same features as Verma modules for finite-dimensional
      semisimple complex Lie algebras, the module $V(\l)$ is
      said to be a {\it Verma module} for $A(\a,\be,\ga)$. 
      \b  
      \subhead {Weight modules} \endsubhead 
      \m
      If we multiply the relation $d^2 u - \a dud - \be u d^2 = \ga d$
      on the left by $u$ and the relation $d u^2 - \a udu - \be u^2 d = \ga u$
      on the right by $d$ and subtract the second from the first, the resulting
      equation is 
      $$0 = ud^2u - du^2d \quad \quad \text {or} \quad \quad (du)(ud) = (ud)(du).$$
      \n Therefore, the  elements $du$ and $ud$ commute in $A = A(\a,\be,\ga)$.  For
      any basis element $v_n \in V(\l)$, we have $du \cdot v_n = \l_n v_n$ and $ud \cdot v_n
      = \l_{n-1}v_n$.  Using that with $n = 0$ and $\l \neq 0$, it is easy to see that $du$ and $ud$
      are linearly independent.   Let $\h = \C du \oplus \C ud$. 
      \b
      We say an $A$-module $V$ is a {\it weight module} if $V = \bigoplus_{\nu \in \h^*}
      V_\nu$, where $V_\nu = \{v \in V \mid h \cdot v = \nu(h)v$ for all $h \in \h\}$, and
      the sum is over elements in the dual space $\h^*$ of $\h$.  
      Any submodule of a weight module is a weight module.    
      If $V_\nu \neq (0)$, then $\nu$ is a {\it weight} and $V_\nu$ is the
      corresponding {\it weight space}. Each weight $\nu$
      is determined by the pair $(\nu',\nu'')$ of complex numbers, $\nu' = \nu(du)$
      and $\nu'' = \nu(ud)$. In particular, highest weight modules are weight modules in
      this sense. The basis vector $v_n$ of $V(\l)$ is a weight vector whose weight
      is given by the pair $(\l_n,\l_{n-1})$.  Finding these weights explicitly involves
      solving the linear recurrence relation in (10), which can be done
      by standard methods as in [Br, Chap.7] for example.

      If $\a,\be$ are
      real, then it is natural to take  $t  = \displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{\a^2+4\be}}{2}$
      in the above calculations.
      \m 
      Let us consider several special cases. 
      \m
      \n {\bf Example (a)}. \   Recall that 
      the universal enveloping algebra $U(\fsl)$ of $\fsl$ is
      isomorphic to the algebra $A(2,-1,-2)$, and the universal enveloping
      algebra $U({\frak H})$ of the Heisenberg Lie algebra $\frak H$ is isomorphic
      to $A(2,-1,0)$.  
      Applying (ii) with $s = \a/2 = 1$ and $x_n = n^2 \ga/2$ for any
      algebra
      $A(2,-1,\ga)$,  we have that 
       
      $$\l_n  = \l + (\l+\frac{\ga}{2})n + \frac{\ga n^2}{2} =  
      (n+1)(\l+\frac {\ga n}{2}).$$
       
      In the $\fsl$-case, it is customary to use the operator $h = du-ud$  rather
      than $du$.  The eigenvalues of $h$ are $\l_n -\l_{n-1} = \l+n\ga = \l-2n$,
      $n = 0,1, \dots$.  The analogous
      computation in the Heisenberg Lie algebra shows that the central element $z = du-ud$
      has  constant eigenvalue $\l_n = \l$. 
      \m
      \n {\bf Example (b)}. \   Recall that the quantum case discussed earlier involves
      the down-up algebra $A([2]_i,-1,0)$.   
      In the particular case of $U_q(\fst)$, the subalgebra generated by
      the $E_i$'s is isomorphic to $A([2],-1,0)$ where $[2] = 
      \displaystyle{\frac{q^2-q^{-2}}{q-q^{-1}}}$, and 
      $\l_n = [n+1]\l = \Big(\displaystyle{\frac{q^{n+1}-q^{-(n+1)}}{q-q^{-1}}}
      \Big)\l$ \ for all $n \geq 0$ 
      in that case.  
      \m
      \n {\bf Example (c)}. \   For the algebra $A(1,1,0)$, 
       the solutions to the associated
      linear recurrence $\l_n = \l_{n-1} + \l_{n-2}$, $\l_0 = \l$, $\l_{-1} = 0$,
      (hence the eigenvalues of $du$ and $ud$ on $V(\l)$)   
      are given by the Fibonacci sequence
      $\l_0 = \l$, $\l_1 = \l$, $\l_2 = 2 \l$, $\l_3 = 3\l$, $\l_4 = 5 \l$,
      $\dots$.  In this case, the equations in Proposition 12 reduce to 
      $\displaystyle{\l_n = \l\frac {\sqrt 5}{5}\left( \left (\frac {1 + \sqrt 5}
      {2}\right)^{n+1} -\left(\frac {1 - \sqrt 5} {2}\right)^{n+1}\right).}$ 
       
      \m 
      In [BR] we investigated in detail the weight space and submodule structure of the
      Verma module $V(\l)$.  Roots of unity play a critical role in determining
      the dimension of a weight space.  We introduced ‘‘category $\Cal O$'' modules
      in the spirit of [BGG] 
      and showed the simple objects were highest weight modules,  and we explored
      a more general category $\Cal O'$ of modules for down-up algebras.
      We briefly summarize some of the main results.
      \b 
      \proclaim{Proposition 13}([BR, Secs. 2, 4, 5]) 
      \item {(a)} In $V(\l)$ each weight space is either
      one-dimensional or infinite-dimensional.  If an infinite-dimensional
      weight space occurs, there are only finitely many weights.
      \m
      \item{(b)} If each weight space of $V(\l)$ is
      one-dimensional, then the proper submodules of $V(\l)$ have the
      form $N =$ span$_\C\{v_j \mid j \geq n+1\}$ for some $n \geq  0$ with $\l_n = 0$.
      Hence they are contained in $M(\l) =$ span$_\C\{v_j \mid j \geq m+1\}$,
      where $\l_m = 0$ and $m$ is minimal with that property.   
      \m
      \item{(c)} If $\gamma = 0 = \lambda$, then
      $V(\l)$ has infinitely many maximal proper submodules, each
      of the form 
      $N^{(\tau)} = \text{span}_\C\{v_n -\tau v_{n-1}\mid n = 1,2, \dots\}$
      for some $\tau \in \C$, and infinitely many one-dimensional
      simple modules,  $L(0,\tau) = V(0)/N^{(\tau)}$.  In
      all other cases, $M(\l)$ is the unique maximal submodule of $V(\l)$,
      and there is a unique simple highest weight module,
      $L(\l)= V(\l)/M(\l)$, of weight $\l$  up to
      isomorphism. \endproclaim
      \m
      \n {\bf Example}. \   Recall that the poset $\Cal L(2,2)$ affords a
      representation of the down-up algebra $A(1,-1,1)$. It is easy
      to see that the down and up operators satisfy $d(\u 0) = 0$
      and $du(\u 0) = \u 0$, where $\u 0 = (0,0)$. Thus, the
      element $\u 0 \in \Cal L(2,2)$ generates a highest weight module
      with $\l = 1$.     If we solve
      the corresponding recurrence relation in Proposition 12, we get from
      (i) that $r_1 = 1/2(1 + \sqrt{-3})$, $r_2 = 1/2(1 - \sqrt{-3})$,
      and $\l_n = 1+ (r_2^n - r_1^n)/(r_2-r_1)$.  Since $r_1^3 = -1 = r_2^3$,
      (and hence $r_1,r_2$ are 6th roots of unity), 
      we see that the sequence $\l_0 = \l,\l_1,\l_2, \dots,$ is given
      by $1,2,2,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,\dots$.  Thus, in the Verma module
      $V(1)$, the maximal submodule $M(1) =$ span$_\C\{v_j \mid j \geq 5\}$.
      The irreducible quotient $L(1) = V(1)/M(1)$ is 5-dimensional, and it is
      spanned modulo $M(1)$ by $v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3, v_4$.  As an
      $A(1,-1,1)$-module, $\Cal L(2,2)$ decomposes as $L(1) \oplus L(0)$,
      where we identify the copy of $L(1)$ with the span of the vectors
      $v_0 = (0,0)$, $v_1 =
      (1,0)$, $v_2 = (2,0) + (1,1)$,
      $v_3 = 2 \cdot (2,1)$, $v_4 = 2 \cdot (2,2)$, and $L(0)$ with
      the span of $(2,0) - (1,1)$.  
      \b
      \subhead  The structure of down-up algebras \endsubhead  
      \m
      >From a ring theoretic viewpoint, down-up algebras exhibit many interesting
      features. For example, it is apparent from the
      defining relations that
      the monomials $u^i(du)^jd^k,$ $i,j,k = 0,1, \dots$ in
      a down-up algebra $A = A(\a,\be,\ga)$   
      determine a spanning set.  
      In [BR, Thm. 3.1] we applied the Diamond Lemma (see [Be]) to prove a 
      Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt type result for down-up algebras.  There
      is one essential ambiguity,  $(d^2u)u  = d(du^2)$,  and the result of
      resolving the ambiguity in the two possible ways is the same.  
      \m
      \proclaim {Theorem 14} (Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem) Assume $A =
      A(\a,\be,\ga)$ is a down-up algebra over $\C$. Then
      $\{u^i(du)^jd^k \mid i,j,k = 0,1,\dots \}$ is a basis of $A$.
      \endproclaim
      \m
      The Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is a natural dimension to assign to an algebra $A$,
      and in many cases (such as when $A$ is  a domain), 
      it provides important structural information. 
      Theorem 14 enables us to compute the GK-dimension of any down-up algebra $A =
      A(\a,\be,\ga)$.   The spaces  $A^{(n)} =$ span$_\C\{u^i (du)^j d^k \mid
      i+2j+k \leq n\}$ afford a filtration
      $(0) \subset A^{(0)} \subset A^{(1)} \subset \dots \subset \cup_n A^{(n)} =
      A(\a,\be,\ga)$ of the down-up algebra, and $A^{(m)} A^{(n)} \subseteq A^{(m+n)}$ since the
      defining relations replace the words $d^2 u$ and $d u^2$ by words of the
      same or lower total degree.  The number of monomials $u^i (du)^j d^k$
      with $i+2j+k = \ell$ is $(m+1)(m+1)$ if $\ell = 2m$ and is $(m+1)(m+2)$
      if $\ell = 2m+1$.    Thus, dim$A^{(n)}$ is a polynomial in $n$ with
      positive coefficients of degree 3, and 
      the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is given by
      $$ 
      \text{GKdim}\big(A(\a,\be,\ga)\big) = \limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} \log_n(\dim
      A^{(n)})
       = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}{\frac {\ln\Big(\dim
      A^{(n)}\Big)}{\ln n}} = 3.$$
      \m
      \proclaim {Proposition 15}([BR, Sec. 3]) If $A(\a,\be,\ga)$
      has infinitely many simple Verma modules
      $V(\l)$, then the intersection  of the
      annihilators of the simple Verma modules is zero.  \endproclaim   
      \m
      It follows immediately that for such a down-up algebra $A(\a,\be,\ga)$
      the Jacobson radical, which is the intersection
      of the annihilators of all the simple modules, is zero.
      \m
      When $\be = 0$, then $d(du - \a ud -\ga) = 0$
      so that  $A(\a,\be,\ga)$ has zero divisors for any choice of $\a,\ga \in \C$.
      Necessary and sufficient conditions for $A(\a,\be,\ga)$ to be a domain or to be
      Noetherian have been proven recently 
      using Theorem 14:
      \m
      \proclaim {Proposition 16}([KMP], and compare also [K2].) For a down-up algebra $A =
      A(\a,\be,\ga)$, the following are equivalent:
      \s
      \item{}{(i)} $\beta \neq 0$.
      \s
      \item{}{(ii)} $A$ is a domain. 
      \s
      \item{}{(iii)} $A$ is right and left Noetherian.
      \s
      \item{}{(iv)} $\C[du,ud]$ is a polynomial ring in the two variables,
      (i.e. $du$ and $ud$ are algebraically independent). \endproclaim
      \m
       A down-up algebra $A = A(\a,\be,\ga)$ is $\Z$-graded by assigning deg$(d) = -1$ and
      deg$(u) = 1$ and extending to all of $A$ by setting deg$(ab)$ = deg$(a)$+deg$(b)$.
      Then $A = \bigoplus_{n \in \Z} A_n$ where $A_n = \{a \in A \mid$ deg$(a) = n\}$,
      and $A_0$ is a commutative subalgebra.
      It is shown in [BR] that if $A$ has infinitely many
      simple Verma modules, the center lies in $A_0$. The center of $A$ has
      been completely described in recent work ([K2] and [Z]).
