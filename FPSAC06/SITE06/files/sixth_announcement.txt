Opening Reception
-----------------

Join us for the opening reception for the conference that
will be held along the beach of Mission Bay a short walk
south from the hotel. This will be between San Jose Pl and
Santa Clara Pl at Mission Bay (parking available at Santa
Clara Pl and Mission Bay).

* 5:30 p.m. Sunday, June 18th, 2006
* Santa Clara Pl & Bayside Walk, San Diego, CA 92109
(you may enter these coordinates into Google Maps to locate it).


Information about talks and posters
-----------------------------------

Poster presentations will have access to one side of a poster-board
of size at least 6' x 8' (1.8m x 2.4m). Posters sessions are
scheduled on Tuesday, June 20th and Thursday June 22nd.  You may
check the schedule online to determine which posters are scheduled
for each of those days.

Time will be rather tight and we have 30 minutes scheduled
for each of the refereed talks.  Speakers should plan the length of
their talk to be 20-25 minutes INCLUDING time for questions.  This
will allow at least 5 minute breaks between the talks.

Speakers will have access to either two overhead projectors or one
computer projector.  If you are planning to use the computer projector
then we recommend using PDF format.  We can transfer your talk onto
our computer ahead of time if it is in PDF format, reducing the amount
of setup time.  If you will be using PowerPoint or Keynote or some other
package, then you will need to use your own computer.


Banquet
-------

The banquet will be held on the grounds of the hotel along the beach
of Mission Bay.  We will need to submit a final count for the number
of people who will attend the banquet the Friday before the beginning
of the conference. 

If you are thinking of attending and have not signed up for the banquet
then please let us know right away by emailing: fpsacreg@mathstat.yorku.ca
We will then ask you to pay when you get here, or you may send a check.


Afternoon Excursions - Wednesday, June 21, 2006
-----------------------------------------------

The schedule for the conference allows us some time off on Wednesday
afternoon.  We are fortunate to be in an area of San Diego where there
is lots to do in a short walking distance.  Here are a few suggestions
for things to do locally:

* Rent a bike, ride to e.g. Point Loma, Balboa or Presido Park
* Take a surf lesson
* Boogie board or swimming at the beach
* Rent a sailboard or kayak
* Rollerblading along 14 miles of bike paths of Mission Bay park

The cost of renting equipment from the hotel will be posted at the
conference website.

If you would like to leave the area of Pacific Beach it is easy to
arrange for travel to any one of San Diego's many tourist attractions.
Cloud 9 can take any size group all over Southern California, and even
down to Mexico.  To coordinate travel through Cloud 9, call
858.505.4900 or visit www.cloud9shuttle.com.
The hotel can also help you make transportation arrangements as well as
sell tickets to any of the following attractions:

* Sea World
* San Diego Zoo
* Wild Animal Park
* Balboa Park and local museums (science center, natural history
  museum, Timkin Art gallery, and others)
* Old Town
* Presido Park and Sierra Mission
* Point Loma and Cabrillo National Monument

We will be arranging a group tour to the San Diego Zoo.
If you are interested in this option, details will be available
at the beginning of the conference and we will ask you to sign
up then.
