          <h2>About San Diego, California</h2>

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</a>
            is the United States first largest state in population and
            the third largest in area.  It makes up the sixth largest economy in the
            world.  San Diego is the U.S.'s <strike>seventh</strike> <a
            href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060621/news_1n21pop.html">eighth</a> largest and it is California's
            third largest city.  Do not get too mislead by map distances when making
            your travel plans, California is comparable in area and dimensions to
            Italy, and the greater San Diego area is about half the size of Sicily.
            An address in San Diego usually means in San Diego county and not within
            the downtown San Diego area.  <a href="http://pacificbeach.org/">Pacific
            Beach</a> is a community within San Diego where the conference will be held.
            
        <h2>Getting to San Diego</h2>
            
            <a href="http://www.san.org/">San Diego International Airport</a> (SAN)
            is named "Lindbergh Field" after Charles Lindbergh, the first aviator to
            fly across the Atlantic.  While it is a modern airport, it is also very small
            compared to the size of the city that it serves.  Most national and
            international carriers serve Lindbergh Field, but direct service to and
            from Lindbergh Field is not always guaranteed. It is also possible to
            instead fly to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) or Ontario
            International Airport (ONT), which are both several hours from San Diego
            either by <a
            href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Station/Station_Page&cid=1080080551420">Amtrak
            train</a> (LAX only) or <a href="http://www.xpressshuttle.com/">airport
            shuttle</a> (LAX or ONT). However, given the distance from the Los Angeles
            area to the San Diego area, this latter option is not recommended in lieu
            of direct travel to Lindbergh Field.
            
        <h2>Ground Transportation</h2>
            
            Upon arriving at San Diego International Airport, you will need to get to
            Pacific Beach. Taxi service and <a
            href="http://www.sdcommute.com/Rider_Information/routes/mapstts.asp">public
            transportation</a> (bus route 992 to bus route 30) are two popular methods
            for getting to your destination. However, the more recommended method is by
            airport shuttle. It costs approximately USD$12&ndash;25 (for a single
            passenger based on a round trip fare) to arrange for a shuttle to take you
            from the San Diego International Airport to a hotel in Pacific Beach.
            
            <br /><br />
            
            A list of shuttle companies can be found via the <a
            href="http://www.san.org/airport/ground_transportation/shuttle_services.asp">San
            Diego International Airport website</a>.   You may want to book your shuttle
            in advance. The location of the conference is the <a
            href="http://www.catamaranresort.com/">Catamaran Resort</a> in Pacific Beach
            (area code 92109). The best rate for a single passenger that the
            conference organizers were able to find is with Cloud 9 Shuttle, when booked
            as a round trip in advance of arrival.
            
            
        <h2>About the conference location</h2>
            
            The conference will be held at the Catamaran Resort in Pacific Beach. The street
            address of the hotel is <a
            href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3999+Mission+Boulevard,+san+diego,+ca">3999
            Mission Boulevard, San Diego, California</a>. This is an area with a lot to do
            outdoors.  It is adjacent to both the beach of the Pacific Ocean and San Diego's
            Mission Bay.
            
        <h2>Climate</h2>
            
            One of the reasons for California's and San Diego's growth is that the <a
            href="http://meteora.ucsd.edu/photos/san-clim.gif">climate is very temperate</a>.
            It is rarely too hot or too cold during most of the year, and it has become a
            popular place to settle. Average winter and summer temperatures differ by 14F
            (8C), so there are no extremes.  The average temperature for the month of June
            in San Diego is 67F (20C). The mean high temperature for June is 72F (22C), and
            the mean low temperature for June is 65F (18C). It is possible we will see very
            temperate and even slightly cool temperatures during June, so it is a good idea
            to bring a light jacket in preparation for breezy weather along the coast.

          <h2>Visa requirements</h2>

            Those of you who will be traveling to the United States from a foreign country
            should consult the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/visa_1750.html">U.S.
            State Department's Visa page</a>, in particular the page on <a
            href="http://www.unitedstatesvisas.gov/obtainingvisa/index.html">obtaining
            a travel visa</a>.

            <br /><br />

            Citizens from <a
            href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html">countries
            on the visa waiver program</a> will need to have a machine readable passport.
