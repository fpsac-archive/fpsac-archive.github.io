<h3>Participant Support</h3> 
<p> 
The conference expects to provide limited financial support to contribute to travel and living expenses during the conference. First priority will be given to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, and--in some exceptional cases--to qualified undergraduates. We encourage applications from members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.
</p>
<p> 
Those requesting support should also ask a mentor to write a supporting letter of recommendation on their behalf and to email it to <a href="mailto:fpsac2010.request.for.support@gmail.com">Thomas Bliem</a>. If the participant is still a student, then this letter should preferably be written by the participant's faculty supervisor.
</p>
<p>
Requests for support should be emailed to <a href="mailto:fpsac2010.request.for.support@gmail.com">Thomas Bliem</a> no later than April 1, 2010, and contain the following (text only, no attachments, please):
</p> 
<ul>
<li>Name:</li>
<li>E-mail Address:</li>
<li>University/Organization:</li>
<li>Current Position:</li>
<li>Year of Ph.D.:</li>
