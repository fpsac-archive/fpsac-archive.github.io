<h2>
participant support
</h2> 

<p>
The conference expects to provide limited financial support to contribute to travel and living expenses during the conference. First priority will be given to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, and--in some exceptional cases--to qualified undergraduates. We encourage applications from members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.
