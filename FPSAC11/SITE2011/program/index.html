	>An alternative approach to alternating sign matrices</em
	></p
      ><p
      >Abstract: Alternating sign matrices were first defined by Robbins and Rumsey in the early 1980s when they discovered that the <span class="math"
	>λ</span
	>-determinant, a natural generalization of the determinant, has an expansion as a sum over all alternating sign matrices, just as the ordinary determinant has an expansion as a sum over permutation matrices. Later it was observed that physicists had been studying a model for square ice that is equivalent to alternating sign matrices for a long time. Since then these square ice techniques are a standard tool to attack various enumeration problems related to alternating sign matrices.</p
      ><p
      >In my talk I shall present an alternative approach to alternating sign matrix enumeration which is more in the spirit of Zeilberger's original proof of the alternating sign matrix theorem. Starting point is an operator formula for the number of monotone triangles with prescribed bottom row. Refined enumerations of alternating sign matrices with respect to a fixed set of boundary columns and rows can be expressed in terms of this operator formula. This enables us to translate certain identities for the operator formula to identities for refined enumerations of alternating sign matrices. This leads, on the one hand, to systems of linear equations that determine the numbers uniquely, and, on the other hand, to surprisingly simple linear relations between them. I will also report on recent attempts to translate these calculations into more combinatorial reasonings.</p

	></p
      ><p
      >Abstract: Soliton solutions of the KP equation have been studied since 1970, when Kadomtsev and Petviashvili proposed a two-dimensional nonlinear dispersive wave equation now known as the KP equation. It is well-known that the Wronskian approach to the KP equation provides a method to construct soliton solutions. More recently, several authors have focused on understanding the regular soliton solutions that one obtains in this way: these come from points of the totally non-negative Grassmannian.</p
      ><p
      >In joint work with Yuji Kodama, we establish a tight connection between Postnikov's theory of total positivity for the Grassmannian, and the structure of regular soliton solutions to the KP equation. This connection allows us to apply machinery from total positivity to KP solitons. In particular, we classify the soliton graphs coming from the totally non-negative Grassmannian, when the absolute value of the time parameter is sufficiently large. We demonstrate an intriguing connection between soliton graphs and the cluster algebras of Fomin and Zelevinsky. Finally, we apply this connection towards the inverse problem for KP solitons.</p

	>The Law of Aboav--Weaire and its analogue in three dimensions</em
	></p
      ><p
      >Abstract: When investigating the structure of metals it is known that the atoms lie in a lattice structure. However, the lattice property only holds locally, that is, in a three dimensional cell called a grain. Bordering the grain is a boundary where the atoms lie chaotically, and beyond that is a new grain where the lattice has a different orientation. The structure of these grains amounts to a three dimensional simple subdivision of space.</p
      ><p
      >Looking at the two dimensional analogue, one observes that grains with a small number of sides tend to be surrounded by grains with a large number of sides, and vice versa. The Law of Aboav--Weaire states that the average number of sides of the neighbors of an <span class="math"
	><em
	  >n</em
	  ></span
	>-sided grain should be roughly <span class="math"
	>5+6/<em
	  >n</em
	  ></span
	>. By introducing the correct error term we prove this law of Material Science and discuss its extension to three dimensions.</p

      >Abstract: The theory of map enumeration was started by Tutte in the 1960s, in an attempt to shed light on the four colour problem, and since then the field has grown considerably. Many classes of maps have been enumerated, including maps on surfaces, and connections have been found to other fields, particularly to statistical physics. More recently, several classes of (unembedded) graphs have been analyzed, in particular planar graphs and graphs on surfaces, and precise asymptotic estimates have been obtained. In the talk we will review these results and the companion results on the structure of random graphs from these families. The main tool in our work is analytic combinatorics, as developed by Philippe Flajolet.</p

	></p
      ><p
      >Abstract: The tree metric theorem provides a combinatorial four point condition that characterizes dissimilarity maps derived from pairwise compatible split systems. A similar (but weaker) four point condition characterizes dissimilarity maps derived from circular split systems (Kalmanson metrics). The tree metric theorem was first discovered in the context of phylogenetics and forms the basis of many tree reconstruction algorithms, whereas Kalmanson metrics were first considered by computer scientists, and are notable in that they are a non-trivial class of metrics for which the traveling salesman problem is tractable. We will review these theorems via the unifying framework of the (tropical) space of trees and extensions to PQ- and PC-trees, and will discuss applications to phylogenetic reconstruction. In particular, we will provide an explanation for the peculiar form of the balanced minimum evolution criterion popular in phylogenetics. The work to be presented is joint with Aaron Kleinman.</p

In a seminal paper Brooks, Smith, Stone and Tutte (1940) discussed squarings related to segment contact representations of planar quadrangulations. Regarding the squares of a squaring as vertices and edges as being defined by contacts we obtain the square dual graph. Schramm (1993) showed that 5-connected inner triangulations of a 4-gon can be represented as square duals. In this talk we review the plane situation and present some results concerning squarings of the torus and the graphs represented by them.</p
