<h4>Submission of final versions of accepted abstracts</h4>

<p>
<em> The option to submit extended abstracts for consideration for
FPSAC 2011 closed on November 15, 2010 at 23:59 PST.  This page is
intended for those whose submitted extended abstracts have been
accepted as talks or posters.  </em>
</p>

<p>Before submitting a new version of your accepted extended abstract,
<em>please</em> follow the guidelines given below.  There are
requirements for your final submission that are in addition to the
requirements for your original submission.  These additional
requirements are given first.  When your revised version is ready,
please submit it through the <a
href="https://www.softconf.com/b/fpsac2011/" target="_blank">START
Conference Manager</a>.  The submission page now includes an
opportunity for students to indicate their eligibility for the award
for the best extended abstract submitted by a graduate student.  The
deadline for revised submissions is
<center>
<b>
April 29, 2011 at 23:59 (<a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/na/pst.html">PST</a>)
</b>.
</center>
</p>

<p>The accepted extended abstracts will be published in a proceedings
volume of <a href="http://www.dmtcs.org/dmtcs-ojs/index.php/dmtcs"
target="_blank">DMTCS (Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer
Science)</a>. The authors will retain the right to publish a full
version of their work in another journal. <em>Authors who do intend to
publish a full version elsewhere should, however, make sure that their
conference contribution is clearly an extended abstract of this full
version</em>.
</p>


<h4>Instructions for authors specific to final version</h4>

<ol>
<li> Your new submission should consist of your (La)TeX file, along
with any supporting files.  Since the proceedings are being published
in DMTCS, you must continue to use the dmtcs.cls class file.

<li>Please take special care with the `author', `title', `keywords'
commands and the `abstract' environment. <em>None</em> of them should
include unbreakable spaces (`\ ' or `~'), non-ascii characters,
`\cite' or `\ref' commands, or any user-defined commands.  Write out
any citations, rather than referencing the bibliography.

<li> While you were strongly encouraged to include a summary in French
in your original version, you are <em>required</em> to do so in your
final version.  If you are not a French speaker then, as a first
option, ask a French speaking colleague to provide an abstract. If you
cannot find anyone to help, please contact <tt>axel[at
sign]math.kth.se</tt> and we will provide a translation.

<li> Since the local proceedings will be available in both postscript
and pdf formats, please send your figures in both postscript (eps) and
pdf formats.  The (standard) package graphicx is used by dmtcs.cls to
include graphical data; please do not use epsf or similar.  Use the
includegraphics command to incorporate figures into your extended
abstract.  Your use of the command can be as simple as
<pre>

\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figure_filename}
</pre>
<em>Note that the file name is given without an extension (pdf or
eps).  Don't include the extension of the graphic file in the command!
We will be processing your file for both postscript and pdf, so please
leave the choice of the desired format to the graphicx package.</em> A
typical inclusion of a figure as part of a LaTeX figure environment
would look something like: 
<pre>

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
  \begin{center} 
    %% Don't use epsfile!
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figure_filename}
    \caption{Your caption here} 
    \label{fig:figure_label}
  \end{center} 
\end{figure}
</pre> 

<li> Extended abstracts, when compiled using the dmtcs.cls
class file, should not exceed 12 pages, even after addressing the
referees' suggestions.  Extended abstracts should be submitted
electronically through the <a
href="https://www.softconf.com/b/fpsac2011/" target="_blank">START
Conference Manager</a>

<li> Finally, please fill in <a href="copyright.pdf">the copyright form</a> and send it to
<pre>

 Linkoping University

<h4>Instructions for authors (original submission)</h4>

<p> <em> For your reference, we include here the instructions that
were given for your original submission.  </em>
</p>

<p>The accepted extended abstracts will be published in a proceedings
volume of <a href="http://www.dmtcs.org/dmtcs-ojs/index.php/dmtcs"
target="_blank">DMTCS (Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer
Science)</a>. The authors will retain the right to publish a full
version of their work in another journal. <em>Authors who do intend to
publish a full version elsewhere should, however, make sure that their
conference contribution is clearly an extended abstract of this full
version</em>.</p>

<p> 
In order to prepare your submission, please take the following steps
to format your document according to the specifications of DMTCS. Please
prepare your document using standard LaTeX. If you have any user
macros, please include them in your submission.
</p> 
 
<ol> 
  <li> Download and unpack the file <a href="dmtcs/sample.tar.gz">sample.tar.gz</a> or, if you prefer, download the files it contains individually and place them all in one folder:
<ul> 
<li> the LaTex class file <a href="dmtcs/FPSACsubmission/dmtcs.cls"
    target="_blank">dmtcs.cls</a> ;
</li> 
<li> the main LaTeX file <a href="dmtcs/FPSACsubmission/sample.tex"
    target="_blank">sample.tex</a> ;
</li> 
<li> the graphics files <a href="dmtcs/FPSACsubmission/dmtcs.pdf" target="_blank">dmtcs.pdf</a> and <a href="dmtcs/FPSACsubmission/dmtcs.eps" target="_blank">dmtcs.eps</a> .
</li> 
<li> If you wish to use BibTeX, you may also want the <a href="dmtcs/FPSACsubmission/sample.bib">sample.bib</a> file.
</li> 
</ul> 
LaTeX the sample.tex file and make sure that your
    output matches this <a href="dmtcs/FPSACsubmission/sample.pdf"
    target="_blank">sample.pdf</a> file.  Then use the sample.tex file as your template.  Your submission can be in either postscript or pdf format.  
</li> 
<li> 
 Follow the directions given in <a href="dmtcs/FPSACsubmission/sample.pdf" target="_blank">sample.pdf</a>.  When the instructions in sample.pdf are in conflict with the FPSAC-specific instructions given on this page, please follow the instructions on this page.  
</li> 
 
  <li> 
    Fill in your author and institution information.
  </li> 
 
  <li> 
    If your title is rather long, please give a short title
    substitution for the inside headers, e.g. \title[short
    title]{Long, wordy title} . The same goes for your name, if you
    have a preferred short form.
  </li> 
 
  <li> 
    You must provide 3 to 6 keywords in the form
    \keywords{keyword1, keyword2, keyword3}
    that describe the topic of your paper.
  </li> 
 
  <li> 
Include a summary with citations written out rather than
referencing the bibliography. FPSAC/SFCA has a tradition of
encouraging bilingualism, and thus you are strongly encouraged to
include a summary in French. There are people available to help with
this, if help is required. Please format your summary as follows (note
the nested structure):
 
<pre> 
\begin{abstract}
\paragraph{Abstract.}
text in english
 
\paragraph{R\'esum\'e.}
texte en fran&ccedil;ais

\end{abstract} 
</pre> 
  </li> 
 
  <li> 
    Extended abstracts, when compiled using the dmtcs.cls class file, should
    not exceed 12 pages.  They should be submitted electronically through the <a href="https://www.softconf.com/b/fpsac2011/" target="_blank">START Conference Manager</a> as either postscript or pdf files.
  </li> 
</ol>
